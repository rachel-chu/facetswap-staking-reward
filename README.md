# StakingRewards-rubidity

This repository contains the Rubidity implementation of the `StakingRewards` smart contract, initially developed in Solidity for Ethereum-based staking applications. The project demonstrates adapting Ethereum smart contract logic to the Rubidity language, which is designed for creating Dumb Contracts on the Facet platform.

## Project Overview

The `StakingRewards` contract in Rubidity is a direct translation of its Solidity counterpart, maintaining core functionalities while leveraging Rubidity's features. It's designed to handle staking, withdrawal, and reward distribution for tokens in a decentralized finance (DeFi) context.

## Contract Features

- **Staking**: Users can stake tokens.
- **Withdrawal**: Users can withdraw their staked tokens.
- **Reward Calculation**: Calculation of rewards over time for staked tokens.
- **Reward Distribution**: Users can claim accumulated rewards.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have a Rubidity environment set up to interact with the Facet platform.
